In September 2012, I had the change to present a talk at PuppetConf 2012.  The tile of may talk was
[Using Service Oriented Operation and Provisioning at Financial Times](http://www.slideshare.net/emekamosanya/using-service-oriented-operation-and-provisioning-at-financial-times).

This is the first time that I described my concept of SOOP (Service Oriented Operation and Provisioning)
as developped for the Financial Times.  Stay posted I am currently writing a post giving more details
on SOOP, the rationals and the lessons learned when trying to apply it to a medium sized organisation.
