Here is some notes on building a simple Centos base image to us with VirtualBox to use
in a SOOP project.

## 1. Download Centos 6 image

The current version is Centos 6.3. Downloaded the
[CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso](http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/centos/6.3/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso)
image from the SWITCH mirror. There are two images but only the first one is necessary.
